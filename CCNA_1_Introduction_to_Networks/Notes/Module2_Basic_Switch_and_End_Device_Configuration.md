# Module 2: Basic Switch and End Device Configuration

## 2.0. Introduction

### 2.0.1 Why should I take this module?

As part of your career in networking, you might have to set up a new network or maintain and upgrade an existing one. In either case, youâ€™ll configure switches and end devices so that they are secure and perform effectively based on your requirements.

Out of the box, switches and end devices come with some general configuration. But for your particular network, switches and end devices require your specific information and instructions.

### 2.0.2 What will I learn to do in this module?

**Module Objective**: Implement initial settings including passwords, IP addressing, and default gateway parameters on a network switch and end devices.

### 2.1.1 Operating Systems

All end devices and network devices require an operating system (OS). As shown in the figure, the portion of the OS that interacts directly with computer hardware is known as the kernel. The portion that interfaces with applications and the user is known as the shell. The user can interact with the shell using a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI).

- **Shell** - The user interface that allows users to request specific tasks from the computer. These requests can be made either through the CLI or GUI interfaces.
- **Kernel** - Communicates between the hardware and software of a computer and manages how hardware resources are used to meet software requirements.
- **Hardware** - The physical part of a computer including underlying electronics.
