Packet Tracer is a tool that allows you to simulate real networks. It provides three main menus:
- You can add devices and connect them via cables or wireless.
- You can select, delete, inspect, label, and group components within your network.
- You can manage your network by opening an existing/sample network, saving your current network, and modifying your user profile or preferences.

The Open, Save, Save As, and Exit commands work as they would for any program, but there are two commands that are special to Packet Tracer.

The Open Samples command will display a directory of prebuilt examples of features and configurations of various network and Internet of Things devices included within Packet Tracer.

The Exit and Logout command will remove the registration information for this copy of Packet Tracer and require the next user of this copy of Packet Tracer to do the login procedure again.

Basically, Open Samples is for exploring ready-made network examples, while Exit and Logout is for ending your session and clearing your login information.
