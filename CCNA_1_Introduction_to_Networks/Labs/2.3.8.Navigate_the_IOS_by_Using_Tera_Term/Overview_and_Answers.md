# 2.3.8 Packet Tracer - Navigate the IOS Using a Terminal Client for Console Connectivity - Physical Mode

## Objectives
- Part 1: Access a Cisco Switch through the Serial Console Port
- Part 2: Display and Configure Basic Device Settings
- Part 3: Access a Cisco Router Using a Mini-USB Console Cable

## Background / Scenario

In this Packet Tracer Physical Mode (PTPM) activity, you will learn how to access a Cisco device via a direct local connection to the console port, using the generic terminal emulation program in Packet Tracer. After you have established a console connection with the Cisco device, you can display or configure device settings. In this activity, you will only display settings and configure the clock in this lab.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Access a Cisco Switch through the Serial Console Port

In this part, you will connect a PC to a Cisco switch using a rollover console cable. This connection will allow 
you to access the CLI and display settings and configure the switch.

#### Step 1: Install and investigate a 2960 switch.

1. There are several switches, routers, and other devices on the Shelf. Click and drag the 2960 to the Rack. In Packet Tracer, most devices that you drag to the Rack or the Table are automatically connected to power. Some devices require that you turn on the power. However, a 2960 switch powers up as soon as you move it to the Rack.

2. Right click the 2960 switch and select Inspect Front. Use the zoom tool to get a better view. Notice that there are 24 ports to connect users and two additional ports to connect the switch to other switches or routers.
