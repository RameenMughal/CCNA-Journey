# 2.3 The Command Structure

## 2.3.1 Basic IOS Command Structure

A network administrator must know the basic IOS command structure to be able to use the CLI for device configuration.

A Cisco IOS device supports many commands. Each IOS command has a specific format, or syntax, and can only be executed in the appropriate mode. 

The general syntax for a command, shown in the figure, is the command followed by any appropriate keywords and arguments.

- **Keyword** - This is a specific parameter defined in the operating system (in the figure, ip protocols).
- **Argument** - This is not predefined; it is a value or variable defined by the user (in the figure, 192.168.10.5).

After entering each complete command, including any keywords and arguments, press the Enter key to submit the command to the command interpreter.

## 2.3.2 IOS Command Syntax Check

A command might require one or more arguments. To determine the keywords and arguments required for a command, refer to the command syntax. The syntax provides the pattern, or format, that must be used when entering a command.

As identified in the table, boldface text indicates commands and keywords that are entered as shown. Italic text indicates an argument for which the user provides the value.

For instance, the syntax for using the **description** *command* is description string. The argument is a string value provided by the user. The description command is typically used to identify the purpose of an interface. 

For example, entering the command, `description Connects to the main headquarter office switch`, describes where the other device is at the end of the connection.

The following examples demonstrate conventions used to document and use IOS commands:
- **ping** *ip-address* - The command is ping and the user-defined argument is the ip-address of the destination device. For example, `ping 10.10.10.5`.
- **traceroute** *ip-address* - The command is traceroute and the user-defined argument is the ip-address of the destination device. For example, `traceroute 192.168.254.254`.

If a command is complex with multiple arguments, you may see it represented like this:

Switch(config-if)# **switchport port-security aging** {  **static** | **time** *time* |     **type**   {**absolute** | **inactivity**}

The command will typically be followed with a detailed description of the command and each argument.

The Cisco IOS Command Reference is the ultimate source of information for a particular IOS command.

## 2.3.3 IOS Help Features

The IOS has two forms of help available: **context-sensitive help** and **command syntax check**.

Context-sensitive help enables you to quickly find answers to these questions:
- Which commands are available in each command mode?
- Which commands start with specific characters or group of characters?
- Which arguments and keywords are available to particular commands?

To access context-sensitive help, simply enter a question mark, `?`, at the CLI.

Command syntax check verifies that a valid command was entered by the user. When a command is entered, the command line interpreter evaluates the command from left to right. If the interpreter understands the command, the requested action is executed, and the CLI returns to the appropriate prompt. 

However, if the interpreter cannot understand the command being entered, it will provide feedback describing what is wrong with the command.
