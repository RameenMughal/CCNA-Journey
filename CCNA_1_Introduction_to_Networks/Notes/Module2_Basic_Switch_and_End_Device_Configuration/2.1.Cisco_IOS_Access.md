## 2.1.1 Operating Systems

All end devices and network devices require an operating system (OS). As shown in the figure, the portion of the OS that interacts directly with computer hardware is known as the kernel. The portion that interfaces with applications and the user is known as the shell. The user can interact with the shell using a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI).

- **Shell** - The user interface that allows users to request specific tasks from the computer. These requests can be made either through the CLI or GUI interfaces.
- **Kernel** - Communicates between the hardware and software of a computer and manages how hardware resources are used to meet software requirements.
- **Hardware** - The physical part of a computer including underlying electronics.

When using a CLI, the user interacts directly with the system in a text-based environment by entering commands on the keyboard at a command prompt, as shown in the example. The system executes the command, often providing textual output. The CLI requires very little overhead to operate. However, it does require that the user have knowledge of the underlying command structure that controls the system.
