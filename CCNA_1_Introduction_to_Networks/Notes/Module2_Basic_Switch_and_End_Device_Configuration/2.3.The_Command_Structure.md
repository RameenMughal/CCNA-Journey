# 2.3 The Command Structure

## 2.3.1 Basic IOS Command Structure

A network administrator must know the basic IOS command structure to be able to use the CLI for device configuration.

A Cisco IOS device supports many commands. Each IOS command has a specific format, or syntax, and can only be executed in the appropriate mode. 

The general syntax for a command, shown in the figure, is the command followed by any appropriate keywords and arguments.

- **Keyword** - This is a specific parameter defined in the operating system (in the figure, ip protocols).
- **Argument** - This is not predefined; it is a value or variable defined by the user (in the figure, 192.168.10.5).

After entering each complete command, including any keywords and arguments, press the Enter key to submit the command to the command interpreter.

## 2.3.2 IOS Command Syntax Check

A command might require one or more arguments. To determine the keywords and arguments required for a command, refer to the command syntax. The syntax provides the pattern, or format, that must be used when entering a command.

As identified in the table, boldface text indicates commands and keywords that are entered as shown. Italic text indicates an argument for which the user provides the value.

For instance, the syntax for using the description *command* is description string. The argument is a string value provided by the user. The description command is typically used to identify the purpose of an interface. For example, entering the command, description Connects to the main headquarter office switch, describes where the other device is at the end of the connection.

The following examples demonstrate conventions used to document and use IOS commands:

ping ip-address - The command is ping and the user-defined argument is the ip-address of the destination device. For example, ping 10.10.10.5.
traceroute ip-address - The command is traceroute and the user-defined argument is the ip-address of the destination device. For example, traceroute 192.168.254.254.
If a command is complex with multiple arguments, you may see it represented like this:
