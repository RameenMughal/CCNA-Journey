# 2.4 Basic Device Configuration

## 2.4.1 Device Names

The first configuration command on any device should be to give it a unique device name or hostname. By default, all devices are assigned a factory default name. 

For example, a Cisco IOS switch is "Switch."

The problem is if all switches in a network were left with their default names, it would be difficult to identify a specific device. 

For instance, how would you know that you are connected to the right device when accessing it remotely using SSH? 

The hostname provides confirmation that you are connected to the correct device.

The default name should be changed to something more descriptive. By choosing names wisely, it is easier to remember, document, and identify network devices. 

Here are some important naming guidelines for hosts:
- Start with a letter
- Contain no spaces
- End with a letter or digit
- Use only letters, digits, and dashes
- Be less than 64 characters in length

An organization must choose a naming convention that makes it easy and intuitive to identify a specific device. The hostnames used in the device IOS preserve capitalization and lowercase characters. 

For example, the figure shows that three switches, spanning three different floors, are interconnected together in a network. The naming convention that was used incorporated the location and the purpose of each device. Network documentation should explain how these names were chosen so additional devices can be named accordingly.

When the naming convention has been identified, the next step is to use the CLI to apply the names to the devices. 

As shown in the example, from the privileged EXEC mode, access the global configuration mode by entering the configure terminal command. Notice the change in the command prompt.

~~~
Switch# configure terminal
Switch(config)# hostname Sw-Floor-1
Sw-Floor-1(config)#
~~~

From global configuration mode, enter the command hostname followed by the name of the switch and press Enter. Notice the change in the command prompt name.
