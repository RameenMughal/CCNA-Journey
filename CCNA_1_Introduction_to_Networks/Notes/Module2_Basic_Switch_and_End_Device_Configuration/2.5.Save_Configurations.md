# 2.5 Save Configurations

## 2.5.1 Configuration Files

This topic will show you how to save your configurations.

There are two system files that store the device configuration:
1. **startup-config** - This is the saved configuration file that is stored in NVRAM. It contains all the commands that will be used by the device upon startup or reboot. Flash does not lose its contents when the device is powered off.
2. **running-config** - This is stored in Random Access Memory (RAM). It reflects the current configuration. Modifying a running configuration affects the operation of a Cisco device immediately. RAM is volatile memory. It loses all of its content when the device is powered off or restarted.

The show running-config privileged EXEC mode command is used to view the running config. As shown in the example, the command will list the complete configuration currently stored in RAM
