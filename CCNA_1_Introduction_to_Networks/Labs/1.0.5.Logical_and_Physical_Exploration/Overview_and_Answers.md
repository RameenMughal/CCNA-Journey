# Logical and Physical Exploration

## Background / Scenario

It represents a simplified version of how a small to medium-sized business network might look. 

Most of the devices in the Seward branch office and Warrenton data center are already deployed and configured. You have just been hired to review the devices and networks deployed. 

It is not important that you understand everything you see and do in this activity.

### Notes

- A **console cable** must be connected to the console port because this port is specifically designed for management access to a network device.
- **Management access** means how a network administrator logs into a device to manage its settings.
- Devices can be connected in a variety of ways.
  - For **network connectivity**, devices are typically connected using either a copper straight-through cable or wirelessly.
  - For **management connectivity**, devices are typically connected using either a console cable or USB cable.
- Newer models of networking devices can be accessed through a **USB port for management configuration**. This is necessary because newer laptops and PCs typically do not include an RS232 port for console cable connections.
- A **branch firewall** is a network security device deployed at a branch office (a smaller location of a company) to protect its network from unauthorized access and threats.
- An **IP Phone (Internet Protocol Phone)** is a phone that uses the Internet or IP network to make and receive calls instead of a traditional phone line.
- Packet Tracer maintains two names for the device: a **Display Name** and a **Hostname**.
- **ISP** stands for **Internet Service Provider**. It is a company or organization that provides access to the Internet for individuals, businesses, and organizations.
