# 2.3 The Command Structure

## 2.3.1 Basic IOS Command Structure

A network administrator must know the basic IOS command structure to be able to use the CLI for device configuration.

A Cisco IOS device supports many commands. Each IOS command has a specific format, or syntax, and can only be executed in the appropriate mode. 

The general syntax for a command, shown in the figure, is the command followed by any appropriate keywords and arguments.

- **Keyword** - This is a specific parameter defined in the operating system (in the figure, ip protocols).
- **Argument** - This is not predefined; it is a value or variable defined by the user (in the figure, 192.168.10.5).

After entering each complete command, including any keywords and arguments, press the Enter key to submit the command to the command interpreter.

## 2.3.2 IOS Command Syntax Check

A command might require one or more arguments. To determine the keywords and arguments required for a command, refer to the command syntax. The syntax provides the pattern, or format, that must be used when entering a command.
