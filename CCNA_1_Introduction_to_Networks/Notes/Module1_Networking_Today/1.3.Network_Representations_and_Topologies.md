# 1.3. Network Representations and Topologies

## 1.3.1 Network Representations 

Network architects and administrators must be able to show what their networks will look like. They need to be able to easily see which components connect to other components, where they will be located, and how they will be connected. 

Diagrams of networks often use symbols, like those shown in the figure, to represent the different devices and connections that make up a network.

A diagram provides an easy way to understand how devices connect in a large network. This type of “picture” of a network is known as a topology diagram. The ability to recognize the logical representations of the physical networking components is critical to being able to visualize the organization and operation of a network.

In addition to these representations, specialized terminology is used to describe how each of these devices and media connect to each other:
- **Network Interface Card (NIC)** - A NIC physically connects the end device to the network. It has a unique address (MAC address) that identifies your device.
- **Physical Port** - A connector or outlet on a networking device where the media connects to an end device or another networking device. A physical port is a socket/connector on a device where you plug in a cable.
- **Interface** - Specialized ports on a networking device that connect to individual networks. Because routers connect networks, the ports on a router are referred to as network interfaces. Think of an interface like a bridge — each interface connects one network to another.

**Note**: The terms port and interface are often used interchangeably.

## 1.3.2 Topology Diagrams

Topology diagrams are mandatory documentation for anyone working with a network. They provide a visual map of how the network is connected. 

There are two types of topology diagrams: physical and logical.

### Physical Topology Diagrams

Physical topology diagrams illustrate the physical location of intermediary devices and cable installation, as shown in the figure. You can see that the rooms in which these devices are located are labeled in this physical topology.

### Logical Topology Diagrams

Logical topology diagrams illustrate devices, ports, and the addressing scheme of the network, as shown in the figure. You can see which end devices are connected to which intermediary devices and what media is being used.
