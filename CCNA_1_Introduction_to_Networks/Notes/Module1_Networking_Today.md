### 1.0.4 Video - Getting Started in Cisco Packet Tracer

Packet Tracer is a tool that allows you to simulate real networks. It provides three main menus:
- You can add devices and connect them via cables or wireless.
- You can select, delete, inspect, label, and group components within your network.
- You can manage your network by opening an existing/sample network, saving your current network, and modifying your user profile or preferences.

The Open, Save, Save As, and Exit commands work as they would for any program, but there are two commands that are special to Packet Tracer.

The Open Samples command will display a directory of prebuilt examples of features and configurations of various network and Internet of Things devices included within Packet Tracer.

The Exit and Logout command will remove the registration information for this copy of Packet Tracer and require the next user of this copy of Packet Tracer to do the login procedure again.

Basically, Open Samples is for exploring ready-made network examples, while Exit and Logout is for ending your session and clearing your login information.

## 1.1. Networks Affect our Lives

### 1.1.1 Networks Connect Us

In todayâ€™s world, through the use of networks, we are connected like never before. 

People with ideas can communicate instantly with others to make those ideas a reality. News events and discoveries are known worldwide in seconds. Individuals can even connect and play games with friends separated by oceans and continents.

### 1.1.3 No Boundaries

The internet has changed the manner in which our social, commercial, political, and personal interactions occur. The immediate nature of communications over the internet encourages the creation of global communities. Global communities allow for social interaction that is independent of location or time zone.

The creation of the cloud lets us store documents and pictures and access them anywhere, anytime. So whether we are on a train, in a park, or standing on top of a mountain, we can seamlessly access our data and applications on any device.

## 1.2. Network Components

### 1.2.1 Host Roles

If you want to be a part of a global online community, your computer, tablet, or smart phone must first be connected to a network. That network must be connected to the internet. This topic discusses the parts of a network.

All computers that are connected to a network and participate directly in network communication are classified as hosts. Hosts can be called end devices. Some hosts are also called clients. 

However, the term hosts specifically refers to devices on the network that are assigned a number for communication purposes. This number identifies the host within a particular network. This number is called the Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address identifies the host and the network to which the host is attached.

Servers are computers with software that allow them to provide information, like email or web pages, to other end devices on the network. Each service requires separate server software. 

For example, a server requires web server software in order to provide web services to the network. A computer with server software can provide services simultaneously to many different clients.

As mentioned before, clients are a type of host. Clients have software for requesting and displaying the information obtained from the server, as shown in the figure.
