# 1.7. Network Trends

## 1.7.1 Recent Trends

You know a lot about networks now, what they are made of, how they connect us, and what is needed to keep them reliable. But networks, like everything else, continue to change.

As new technologies and end-user devices come to market, businesses and consumers must continue to adjust to this ever-changing environment. There are several networking trends that affect organizations and consumers:
- Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
- Online collaboration
- Video communications
- Cloud Computing

## 1.7.2 Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)

The concept of any device, for any content, in any manner, is a major global trend that requires significant changes to the way we use devices and safely connect them to networks. This is called Bring Your Own Device (BYOD).

BYOD enables end users the freedom to use personal tools to access information and communicate across a business or campus network. With the growth of consumer devices, and the related drop in cost, employees and students may have advanced computing and networking devices for personal use. These include laptops, notebooks, tablets, smart phones, and e-readers. These may be purchased by the company or school, purchased by the individual, or both.

BYOD means any device, with any ownership, used anywhere.

## 1.7.3 Online Collaboration

Individuals want to connect to the network, not only for access to data applications, but also to collaborate with one another. Collaboration is defined as “the act of working with another or others on a joint project.” 

Collaboration tools, like Cisco WebEx, give employees, students, teachers, customers, and partners a way to instantly connect, interact, and achieve their objectives.

Cisco Webex Teams is a multifunctional collaboration tool that lets you send instant messages to one or more people, post images, and post videos and links. Each team ‘space’ maintains a history of everything that is posted there.

## 1.7.4 Video Communications

Another facet of networking that is critical to the communication and collaboration effort is video. Video is used for communications, collaboration, and entertainment. Video calls are made to and from anyone with an internet connection, regardless of where they are located.

Video conferencing is a powerful tool for communicating with others, both locally and globally. Video is becoming a critical requirement for effective collaboration as organizations extend across geographic and cultural boundaries.

## 1.7.6 Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is one of the ways that we access and store data. Cloud computing allows us to store personal files, even backup an entire drive on servers over the internet. 

For businesses, Cloud computing extends the capabilities of IT without requiring investment in new infrastructure, training new personnel, or licensing new software. These services are available on-demand and delivered economically to any device that is anywhere in the world without compromising security or function.

Cloud computing works because of data centers. A data center is a special place where lots of powerful computers, servers, and storage devices are kept. These facilities are designed to store data and run applications for users. A data center might be as small as one room in a building, or as big as a warehouse filled with servers.

Building and maintaining a data center is very expensive. It requires not only hardware but also cooling systems, backup power, high-speed internet connections, and strong physical security. Because of this, only large organizations like Google, Amazon, or Microsoft usually build and operate their own private data centers.

On the other hand, smaller organizations often cannot afford to build their own. Instead, they rent or lease server and storage space from these larger companies through the cloud. This way, they can still store their data and use advanced computing services without paying the full cost of owning a private data center.

For security, reliability, and fault tolerance, cloud providers often store data in distributed data centers. Instead of storing all the data of a person or an organization in one data center, it is stored in multiple data centers in different locations.

There are four primary types of clouds: Public clouds, Private clouds, Hybrid clouds, and Community clouds, as shown in the table.

## 1.7.7 Technology Trends in the Home

The newest home trends include ‘smart home technology’.

Smart home technology integrates into every-day appliances, which can then connect with other devices to make the appliances more ‘smart’ or automated. 

For example, you could prepare food and place it in the oven for cooking prior to leaving the house for the day. You program your smart oven for the food you want it to cook. It would also be connected to your ‘calendar of events’ so that it could determine what time you should be available to eat and adjust start times and length of cooking accordingly. It could even adjust cooking times and temperatures based on changes in schedule. Additionally, a smart phone or tablet connection lets you connect to the oven directly, to make any desired adjustments. When the food is ready, the oven sends an alert message to you (or someone you specify) that the food is done and warming.

Smart home technology is currently being developed for all rooms within a house. Smart home technology will become more common as home networking and high-speed internet technology expands.

## 1.7.8 Powerline Networking 

Powerline networking for home networks uses existing electrical wiring to connect devices.

Instead of installing new network cables, you plug in special adapters (called powerline adapters) into your wall power sockets. These adapters use the electrical wires already running through the building to transmit data, just like an Ethernet cable would.

Using a standard powerline adapter, devices can connect to the LAN wherever there is an electrical outlet. No data cables need to be installed, and there is little to no additional electricity used. Using the same wiring that delivers electricity, powerline networking sends information by sending data on certain frequencies.

Powerline networking is especially useful when wireless access points cannot reach all the devices in the home. Powerline networking is not a substitute for dedicated cabling in data networks. However, it is an alternative when data network cables or wireless communications are not possible or effective.

## 1.7.9 Wireless Broadband  

In many areas where cable and DSL are not available, wireless may be used to connect to the internet.

### Wireless Internet Service Provider

A Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP) is a type of ISP that provides Internet access using wireless signals instead of cables. Just like Wi-Fi works in your home, a WISP uses similar wireless technology but on a much larger scale. Customers connect to the WISP through an antenna or receiver that communicates with the provider’s access point or hotspot.

WISPs are especially common in rural or remote areas where regular Internet options like DSL, fiber, or cable are not available. By using wireless signals, WISPs can cover large areas without needing to dig up roads or install expensive wiring.

A WISP usually uses an antenna placed on a tall structure like a water tower, radio tower, or sometimes its own transmission tower. This antenna sends and receives wireless Internet signals. To use the service, the subscriber (home or business) has a small dish or antenna installed on their roof that points toward the WISP’s antenna.

That roof antenna connects to a device inside the home (the access unit), which then links to the home’s wired network or Wi-Fi router. From the user’s point of view, the setup looks very similar to having DSL or cable Internet — they still plug into a modem/router and get Internet for their devices.

The only difference: With DSL or cable, the connection from your home to the ISP is through a physical wire (telephone line or coaxial cable). With WISP, that “last mile” connection is wireless.

### Wireless Broadband Service

Another wireless solution for the home and small businesses is wireless broadband

This solution uses the same cellular technology as a smart phone. An antenna is installed outside the house providing either wireless or wired connectivity for devices in the home. In many areas, home wireless broadband is competing directly with DSL and cable services.
