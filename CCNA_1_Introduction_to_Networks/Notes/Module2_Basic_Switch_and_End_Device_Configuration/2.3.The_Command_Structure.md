# 2.3 The Command Structure

## 2.3.1 Basic IOS Command Structure

A network administrator must know the basic IOS command structure to be able to use the CLI for device configuration.

A Cisco IOS device supports many commands. Each IOS command has a specific format, or syntax, and can only be executed in the appropriate mode. 

The general syntax for a command, shown in the figure, is the command followed by any appropriate keywords and arguments.

- **Keyword** - This is a specific parameter defined in the operating system (in the figure, ip protocols).
- **Argument** - This is not predefined; it is a value or variable defined by the user (in the figure, 192.168.10.5).

After entering each complete command, including any keywords and arguments, press the Enter key to submit the command to the command interpreter.

## 2.3.2 IOS Command Syntax Check

A command might require one or more arguments. To determine the keywords and arguments required for a command, refer to the command syntax. The syntax provides the pattern, or format, that must be used when entering a command.

As identified in the table, boldface text indicates commands and keywords that are entered as shown. Italic text indicates an argument for which the user provides the value.

<img width="623" height="230" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e0aaca3-0f9d-48e7-bcec-c127d42d924f" />

For instance, the syntax for using the **description** *command* is description string. The argument is a string value provided by the user. The description command is typically used to identify the purpose of an interface. 

For example, entering the command, `description Connects to the main headquarter office switch`, describes where the other device is at the end of the connection.

The following examples demonstrate conventions used to document and use IOS commands:
- **ping** *ip-address* - The command is ping and the user-defined argument is the ip-address of the destination device. For example, `ping 10.10.10.5`.
- **traceroute** *ip-address* - The command is traceroute and the user-defined argument is the ip-address of the destination device. For example, `traceroute 192.168.254.254`.

If a command is complex with multiple arguments, you may see it represented like this:

Switch(config-if)# **switchport port-security aging** {  **static** | **time** *time* |     **type**   {**absolute** | **inactivity**}

The command will typically be followed with a detailed description of the command and each argument.

The Cisco IOS Command Reference is the ultimate source of information for a particular IOS command.

## 2.3.3 IOS Help Features

The IOS has two forms of help available: **context-sensitive help** and **command syntax check**.

Context-sensitive help enables you to quickly find answers to these questions:
- Which commands are available in each command mode?
- Which commands start with specific characters or group of characters?
- Which arguments and keywords are available to particular commands?

To access context-sensitive help, simply enter a question mark, `?`, at the CLI.

Command syntax check verifies that a valid command was entered by the user. When a command is entered, the command line interpreter evaluates the command from left to right. If the interpreter understands the command, the requested action is executed, and the CLI returns to the appropriate prompt. 

However, if the interpreter cannot understand the command being entered, it will provide feedback describing what is wrong with the command.

## 2.3.4 Video - Context Sensitive Help and Command Syntax Check

The help command is context sensitive so it matters on how and here the question mark is being used.

I can use the question mark `?` in User EXEC Mode to get the commands that are available to use in this mode.

You can type `?` in Privileged EXEC Mode to get the available commands

<img width="479" height="334" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cc0970a-22b0-40ef-83a3-439cde04d8be" />

You can also get the available commands in Global Config Mode by `?`.

You can also use the help command to get the full command name. For Example: I want to use `interface` but I forgot how the command name is:

```
Switch(config)# in?
interface
Switch(config)#
```

Lets say you forgot what parameters that can be used after the `interface`:

```
Switch(config)# interface ?
```

The help syntax checker can be used for mistakes in commands:

By simply just typing `i`, the syntax checker gives me ambiguous command as with the help `?` command you can see there are two possibilities with the `i` in Global Config Mode:

If `interface` is only written then we get incomplete command by the syntax checker. We can check the possible commands by the help `?` feature:

## 2.3.5 Hot Keys and Shortcuts

The IOS CLI provides hot keys and shortcuts that make configuring, monitoring, and troubleshooting easier.

Commands and keywords can be shortened to the minimum number of characters that identify a unique selection. 

For example, the configure command can be shortened to conf because configure is the only command that begins with conf. An even shorter version, con, will not work because more than one command begins with con. Keywords can also be shortened.

The table lists keystrokes to enhance command line editing.

<img width="600" height="600" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff04954a-fb1e-499b-aa3d-5a27dfdd0eda" />

**Note**: While the Delete key typically deletes the character to the right of the prompt, the IOS command structure does not recognize the Delete key.

When a command output produces more text than can be displayed in a terminal window, the IOS will display a “--More--” prompt. The following table describes the keystrokes that can be used when this prompt is displayed.

<img width="620" height="197" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/401e6459-931d-4bbb-8b7c-84990a04587b" />

This table lists commands used to exit out of an operation.

## 2.3.6 Video - Hot Keys and Shortcuts

Use the tab key to get the available command name. For example: If you want to `enable` to get to the Privileged EXEC Mode.

But this command should be only one like `en` only stands for `enable`.

```
Switch>en
Switch>enable
Switch#
```

This will not work for `con` as it has two possibilities: `configure` and `connect`

```
Switch# con
Switch# con?
configure  connect
Switch#
```

You can type `conf` and press tab to get the `configure` automatically.

You can type `configure t` and press tab key to get the `configure terminal` as there is only one argument for `t` in Privileged EXEC Mode

```
Switch# configure t
Switch# configure terminal
```

You can shorten your commands for fast configuration. For Example: `interface FastEthernet 0/1` is a long command which can be written as `int f 0/1`:

```
Switch(config)# int f 0/1
Switch(config-if)# 
```
